# Introduction

This mobile app has only been tested on Android and exists only to demonstrate my current work. I did not architect this at all. I took an existing manual process and automated it as a way to learn Xamarin and Entity Framework Core. The result did provide a working application for my employer but using the existing process.

This app requires the [Inventory Management Web API](https://github.com/thomaslhudson/InventoryManagementAPI).

See the [User Manual](https://github.com/thomaslhudson/InventoryManagement.Mobile/wiki/User-Manual-Wiki) for screenshots and a better understanding of how the app works.
